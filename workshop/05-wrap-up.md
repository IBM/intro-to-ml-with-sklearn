# Wrap up

Thank you for participating in the **Introduction to Machine Learning with sklearn** workshop. We hope you have come away with some useful ideas and find that you can benefit from the content shared in this workshop.

## Summary of the workshop

* We started with an overview of Machine Learning, to learn what it is and how it works. 
* We followed that up with a quick refresher lab on Python for Machine Learning. 
* We performed two additional labs where we trained and tested Machine Learning models using regression and classification algorithms.
* Finally, we used AutoAI to automatically train and compare machine learning algorithms for the input data.
