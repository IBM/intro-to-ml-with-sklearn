# Introduction to Machine Learning with `sklearn` 

Welcome to the workshop! In this workshop we'll be using Jupyter notebooks to learn about and practice machine learning with scikit learn framework (`sklearn`). We use IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service (CP4DaaS) to run the notebooks and build a Machine Learning model with the `scikit`, and we'll demonstrate AutoAI which automated the process of building machine learning models.

## Compatability

This workshop has been tested on [IBM Watson Studio and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com).

The notebooks use `Python 3.7.10`.
